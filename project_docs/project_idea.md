I want to build an AI powered brainstorming and journaling app
that helps users capture their ideas, categorize
them and provide additional content suggestions.

The app should allow users to create entries,
tag them with categories or keywords and generate summaries or related ideas using AI.

This will be a personal productivity tool aimed at helping users organize and expand on their thoughts.

I want to keep this app simple. It only provide the features I've described above.

It shouldn't need to communicate with any external services, such as a remote database or API.
